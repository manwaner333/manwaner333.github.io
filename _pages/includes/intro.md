I will be joining <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/groups/machine-learning/">Machine Learning Group</a> at 
<a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/">Bernoulli Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en">University of Groningen</a>, as an Assistant Professor in February 2026. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/machine-learning-department/">Machine Learning Department</a> at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a>, working with Prof.<a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-fakhreddine-fakhri-karray/">Fakhri Karray</a>. I got my Ph.D degree at <a href="https://www.uis.no/en">University of Stavanger</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/steinar-evje">Steinar Evje</a> in December 2023. Before that, I got my M.S degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/">South China University of Technology</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1228/c14638a242444/page.htm">Youjun Wang</a>, and my B.S degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.qdu.edu.cn/">Qingdao University</a>. I also have more than two years of industry experience at Alibaba Group as a Senior Algorithm Engineer.


My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematics. On one hand, I leverage mathematical theory to enhance model trustworthiness and interpretability. Specifically, I work on large language model safety, privacy, and hallucination by analyzing jailbreak attacks, biases, multimodal risks, and by improving response accuracy in high-stakes domains. On the other hand, I also explore using AI models to identify dynamical systems from observational data, forecast time-series data, and advance scientific computing.
